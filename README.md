# STM32_HAL_I2C_HD44780
HD44780 I2C Library for STM32<br>
<br>
I've implemented a library based on Arduino Liquid Crystal I2C Library and STM32 HAL driver.<br>
I used PCF8574A expander IC and its address was 0x3F.<br>
If you use a different PCF8574x series, You may have to change I2C address.<br>
<br>
As I didn't test all of functions, You may experience some flaws while you're testing.<br>
